For field ST (short tandem repeat), the first line must contain the source(s) from which the information is retrieved.
The value of the source is the xref to the input publication (e.g. ST   Source(s): PubMed=some_pmid).
The typical ST loci for human cell lines are:
Amelogenin, CSF1PO, D2S1338, D3S1358, D5S818, D7S820, D8S1179, D13S317, D16S539, D18S51, D19S433, D21S11, FGA, Penta D, Penta E,
TH01, TPOX, vWA, D1S1656, D2S441, D6S1043, D10S1248, D12S391, D22S1045, DXS101, DYS391, F13A01, F13B, FESFPS, LPL, Penta C, SE33
The repeat value(s) comes right after the locus name e.g. 'ST   D16S539: 9,11'
Typical ST loci for mouse cell lines are:
Mouse STR 1-1, Mouse STR 1-2, Mouse STR 2-1, Mouse STR 3-2, Mouse STR 4-2, Mouse STR 5-5, Mouse STR 6-4, Mouse STR 6-7, Mouse STR 7-1, 
Mouse STR 8-1, Mouse STR 11-2, Mouse STR 12-1, Mouse STR 13-1, Mouse STR 15-3, Mouse STR 17-2, Mouse STR 18-3, Mouse STR 19-2, Mouse STR X-1
Typical ST loci for dog cell lines are:
Dog FHC2010, Dog FHC2054, Dog FHC2079, Dog PEZ1, Dog PEZ3, Dog PEZ5, Dog PEZ6, Dog PEZ8, Dog PEZ12, Dog PEZ20

The field CA (category) is mandatory and its value must be one of:
Cancer cell line, Conditionally immortalized cell line, Embryonic stem cell, Factor-dependent cell line, Finite cell line, Hybrid cell line, 
Hybridoma, Induced pluripotent stem cell, Somatic stem cell, Spontaneously immortalized cell line, Stromal cell line, Telomerase immortalized cell line, 
Transformed cell line, Undefined cell line type
Choose Undefined cell line type only when no other category seems relevant.

The field AG represents the age of the organism when the sample was taken to create the cell line.
If the age is not specified in the publication, use the value 'Age unspecified'.
If the age is expressed in years then use 'Y' to specify the unit e.g. 34 years old becomes 34Y.
If the age is expressed in months, use Y to specify the unit e.g. 11 months become 11M.
If the age is expressed in weeks, use W to specify the unit e.g. 4 weeks become 4W.
If the age is expressed in days, use D to specify the unit e.g. 6 days become 6D.
If the age combines several units (years, months, weeks, days) you can concat the values e.g. 3 years and 6 months become 3Y6M.
If the age is expressed as a range, use '-' between lower and upper boundaries e.g. between 3 and 4 weeks become 3-4W.
It the age is expressed as being more than some value, use '>', e.g. more than 5 years beome >5Y.
It the age is expressed as being less than some value, use '<>>', e.g. less than 6 years beome <6Y.
The age can also be related to a developmental stage, e.g:
Embryo, Adolescent, Blastula, Fetus, Adult, Blastocyst stage, Embryonic stage, Children, Neonate larva, Pupal stage, Larval stage, 
Late embryonic stage, Third instar larval stage  Juvenile, Fourth-fifth instar larval stage, Dorsal closure stage, Fingerling,
Prepubertal, First instar larval stage, Fifth instar larval stage, Tadpole stage, Morula stage, Immature, Blastula stage

The field SX can take the following values:
Female, Male, Mixed sex, Sex ambiguous, Sex unspecified
Mixed sex value is for cell lines originating from multiple individuals having different sexes.

The RX field value is a xref on the input publication. 
The prefix is either PubMed= or DOI= followed with the identifier of the publication. THe RX line must end with a ';'.
If the input publication has a PubMed identifier (pmid), then create a RX with this identifier and no other RX line.
If the input publication has a DOI identifier, then create a RX with this identifier and no other RX line.

The OX field represents the species of the organism from which cell line was sampled.
The OX value is a concatenation of the following elements:
literal 'NCBI_TaxID=', species_taxon_identifier e.g. '9606', literal separator '; ! ', 
species_scientific_name e.g. 'Homo sapiens', literal '(', species_common_name e.g. 'Human', literal ')'.

The DI field value represents a disease suffered by the organism from which the cell line originates.
The value is a concatenation of database_name which is either 'NCIt' or 'ORDO', literal ';', disease_identifier e.g. 'Orphanet_251', 
literal '; ', disease_name e.g. 'Chronic myeloid leukemia'
When you encounter a disease name related to the cell line or to the organism the cell line originates from, 
you MUST call the function "get_disease_line" with the disease name exactly as found in the input document.
After receiving the function result, insert it into the output.
